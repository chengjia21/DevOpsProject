## Testing CI/CD

### Aims : 

1. To create a Markdown to HTML converter via Github Pages, whereby a source file in the Markdown format (index.md) can be displayed in HTML format in a browser (URL : https://chengjia21.github.io/chengjiadevops.github.io/).

2. To have continuous integration/deployment, such that code changes made anytime to the index.md file are continuously deployed to the end user (the viewer of the Github Page)

### Steps taken:

1) Created repository for Github Pages website

2) Designated a publishing source in the repository settings (root of main branch)

3) Created a file (index.md) at the root of the publishing source

4) Added Jekyll theme to Github Pages (Merlot Theme)

5) The index.md file was successfully displayed in HTML, using the Jekyll theme (Merlot) when accessing the https://chengjia21.github.io/chengjiadevops.github.io/ website

6) Amended the index.md file by adding a test list to see if CI/CD process is working. Test successful as the code changes were deployed and shown in the HTML Github Page.
